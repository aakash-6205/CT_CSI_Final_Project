# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the future value of a customer to a business over the entire duration of their relationship. By incorporating factors such as past purchase history, frequency of purchases, and customer demographics, we aim to create an accurate model for Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction.

## Dataset
We have utilized the [Online Retail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/online-retail-dataset) from Kaggle for our analysis.

## Analysis Report

### Customer Segmentation
We segmented customers based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM Analysis). Through this segmentation, we achieved the following insights:

- **Most Valuable Customers**
- **Loyal Customers**
- **New Customers**
- **Lost Customers**: We identified customers who have stopped purchasing, helping us understand why they left and how to regain their loyalty.

### Predictive Modeling
Using RFM analysis, we developed a model to predict future customer spending.

## Conclusion
RFM Analysis is an essential tool for understanding customer behavior and segmenting them based on purchasing habits. It aids in personalizing marketing strategies and enhancing customer engagement and retention.
